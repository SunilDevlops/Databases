The IFNULL function will return the first argument if it is not NULL, otherwise it returns the second argument.

Example: 

Given the table employee as follows:

id	salary
1	100
2	200
3	300
4	200


Implementation:

SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
